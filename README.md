## Howdy, I'm Janne Wald
I'm an ex Psychology/Economics student who developed a deep passion for Computer Science and Software Development. So much so, that I'm already in my **Junior** year here at the **University of Utah**. Currently in classes to explore my interest in **Software/Full Stack Development**, **AI Engineering**, and **Cybersecurity**.   
Speaking of which, **I am actively looking for intern/work experiences** in said categories!
You can email me here: _janne.l.wald@gmail.com_ or message me:  _linkedin.com/in/jannewald/_
#### Education
 - Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, _University of Utah_, Aug 2021 - Present
#### Skills
 - Languages: Python, C#, C++, Java, Bash, MySQL, German :smile:
 - Tools: Git, Docker, VS Code, Visual Studio, PyCharm, IntelliJ, Eclipse, Qt
## Projects
#### Speech-To-Tazer (WIP)
Similar to that one Michael Reeves video. This program uses OpenAIâ€™s Whisper module to live translate microphone input into text.
Will Implement:
 - Web server on Raspberry Pi to parse transmissions
 - Have program transmit words via JSON to web server
 - Create HTML and CSS pages to show words being spoken along with programmable blocklist
 - Close circuit on taser with Raspberry Pi to activate taser on banned word

_**note: University of Utah Git Policy prevents me from publicizing the repos for the below projects**_
_I am more than happy to show off these projects during an interview_

#### Multiplayer Snake Game | C#, Blazor, MySQL, HTTP
Recreated the classic Snake Game but with multiplayer. Players can start a Server.exe, launch a blazor app, then connect and play snake with as many players who have the app.
The client deserializes JSON packets from the server and updates the view. The client also updates a MySQL database on events. These are viewable in real time via a simple HTTP web server. 

#### Spreadsheet Application | C#, Blazor, JSON, Git
Developed a basic Spreadsheet Application in Blazor capable of storing ints, doubles, strings, and functions. This updates live and has many features like: saving/loading, undo/redo, and floating point error handling

#### Threaded Web Proxy | Python, TCP, HTTP
I made an HTTP proxy capable of handling the traffic of MANY people. This project follows all RFC requirements so it can handle all web traffic, allthough anything other than HTTP 1.0 responses are going to return a 400 Bad Request.
Used multithreading and caching along with proper data structures to make it super efficient.
Has many functionalities like live toggleable cache clearing, content filtering, and much more.

## What else am I doing
 - Working Part-Time for the University of Utah's Center for High Performance Computing as a Technical Assistant
 - Being one of the first people to reach 1 Million Science Per Minute in Factorio
   - _please ask me about this I love talking about it_
