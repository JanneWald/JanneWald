 - Web server on Raspberry Pi to parse transmissions
 - Have program transmit words via JSON to web server
 - Create HTML and CSS pages to show words being spoken along with programmable blocklist
 - Close circuit on taser with Raspberry Pi to activate taser on banned word

_I have given screenshots and am more than happy to show off these privately_

#### Multiplayer Snake Game üêç 
_C#, Blazor, MySQL, HTTP_

Recreated the classic Snake Game but with multiplayer! Players can start a Server.exe, launch a blazor app, then connect and play snake with as many players who have the app.
Cool Things:
 - JSON deserialization from server
 - Alt web server and MySQL database to track games live
 - Object collision handling
 - Application states and signals

#### Spreadsheet Application üìÇ
_C#, Blazor, JSON, Git_

Developed a basic Spreadsheet Application that has all the important data calculation necessities.
Cool Things:

#### Threaded Web Proxy
_Python, TCP, HTTP_

A simple HTTP proxy capable of handling the traffic of MANY people. This project follows all RFC requirements so it can handle all web traffic, allthough anything other than HTTP 1.0 responses are going to return a 400 Bad Request.
Cool Things:
 - MultiThreaded
 - No downtime proxy configuration
 - Cacheing (Toggleable)
 - Content Filtering (Toggleable)
